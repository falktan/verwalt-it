# Cursor Rules for verwalt-it

## Powershell usage
- you have a powershell. Use syntax accordingly.

## Project Overview
Node.js application with API services, form handling, and email functionality.

## Key Guidelines
- make a plan first and ask for confirmation
- make small changes at a time

## File Structure
- `/api/` - Backend services and utilities
- `/public/` - Frontend files and forms
- `/tests/` - Jest test files

## Testing
- only created tests if explicitly asked to create a test
- Follow existing test patterns in `/tests/`
- when creating new tests read `docs/technical_documentation/jest.md` first
- DO NOT create new tests when adding functionality - you will be explicitly asked to add tests when needed
